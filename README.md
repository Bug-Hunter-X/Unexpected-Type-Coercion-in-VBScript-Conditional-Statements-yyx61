This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle bug in VBScript related to implicit type coercion within conditional statements.  The `bug.vbs` file showcases the erroneous behavior, while `bugSolution.vbs` provides the corrected implementation.  The issue arises from VBScript's loose typing, potentially leading to incorrect comparisons when comparing numbers represented as strings with numbers represented as integers.
